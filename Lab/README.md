# CAII-Lab-RISCV-Simulator
### Advancing Computer Architecture @ Shanghaitech CS211
## Lab0:   
Modify the source code of the simulator and rewrite part of a C program to achieve CAS (Compare and swap) using LR/SC (Load Reserved/Store Conditional) instructions.
## Lab1:   
Modify the CPU caches in the RISC-V CPU simulator. In task 1, you are asked to modify the three-level CPU cache to be a three-level exclusive Cache with
different write policies. In task 2, you are going to enhance the default LRU cache replacement policy.
## Lab2:  
Read the aforementioned paper Dynamic branch prediction with perceptrons and implement the strategy described in the paper.
## Lab3:  
Modify the RISC-V CPU simulator to support 2 cores and simulate different programs in the different cores at the same time. Then you need to modify the
simulator's cache hierarchy to support basic cache coherence protocol.
